# intro-to-python

This training is designed to be worked through in your own time. However, if you think you or your team may benefit from having someone on hand to help, then please contact Michael.Ratford@justice.gov.uk via Slack, Teams or email to arrange a session.

If you have any comments or something you'd like to add/edit, feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro-to-python/issues) or submit your own Pull Request!

Once you have completed this, or if you are already familiar with juptyerlab and python, you might find [our course on iterables](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/python-training-iterables) useful.

## Prerequisites

This is intended for people who have never (or very rarely) used jupyterlab on the Analytical Platform (AP), or python, before.

### Set up

1. Deploy (if you haven't previously) and then open JupyterLab via [Control Panel](https://controlpanel.services.analytical-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/), under Analytical Tools. Any version should work (go for the latest one if you aren't sure). If you are having a little bit of trouble here, the [user guidance](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/tools/control-panel.html#control-panel) has some more information.

2. You'll need to follow the instructions [here](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/github/set-up-github.html#jupyterlab) up to and including the section "Add the SSH key to GitHub", to allow you to clone this repository on the AP. This can be a little bit tricky - if you are new to using GitHub then do feel free to ask for help in the [#git](https://asdslack.slack.com/archives/C4VF9PRLK) or [#python](https://asdslack.slack.com/archives/C1Q09V86S) Slack channels!

## The course

The course is in three parts. It's best to view [Part 1](Part_1_Jupyterlab.md) on Github and move on to the notebooks for [Part 2](Part_2_Python.ipynb) and [Part 3](Part_3_Pandas.ipynb) in Jupyterlab.
